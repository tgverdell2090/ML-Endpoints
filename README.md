# Machine Learning Endpoints

In this directory, an sklearn linear regression model has been generated inside the `train_model.py` file, and stored inside the `assets/ ` directory.

In the `index.py` file, set up two endpoints that can receive data and return predictions to the client.

## Test API After Line 30
Before going too far, test to make sure the point is working as expected
### 1. Run "ipython"
### 2. Run "from get_predictions import single_prediction"
### 3. Run "single_prediction()"
Afterwards, you should get a prediction

## After finishing the API for Batch Predictions
### 1. Run "ipython"
### 2. Run "from get_predictions import single_prediction"
### 3. Run "single_prediction()
You should expect to see a successful batch prediction
